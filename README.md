Good (Morning/Afternoon/Evening)

My name's Bryce! I'm an aspiring software developer and
enjoy utilizing a multitude of tools to reach simple
solutions to difficult problems.
I live on coffee, am extremely goal oriented, and
absoutely love myself a bagel of any kind with cream cheese.
My hobbies include coding, rock climbing, snowboarding, kayaking,
hiking, reading, playing with my cats, watching Netflix,
and keeping up on current events.
